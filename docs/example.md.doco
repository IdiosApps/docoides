Hello! Let's get some test code in here - a whole file:

An example of a failing Python pytest test:
```python
# content of test_sample.py
def func(x):
    return x + 1


def test_answer():
    assert func(3) == 5
```
---

What if we only want a certain range of lines from a file?
Let's try and get just 2 lines, 6 and 7:

def test_answer():
    assert func(3) == 5
