Hello! Let's get some test code in here - a whole file:

``[An example of a failing Python pytest test](../test/test_sample.py)

---

What if we only want a certain range of lines from a file?
Let's try and get just 2 lines, 6 and 7:

``6:7[An example of a failing Python pytest test](../test/test_sample.py)
